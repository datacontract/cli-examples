Usage examples for the data contract CLI

## Find breaking changes on pull request
In this example the `breaking` command is used in a [simple GitHub action](.github/workflows/breaking.yml) to find breaking changes on pull requests. Take a look at [the failing pull request](https://github.com/datacontract/cli-examples/pull/2).

### Action
```yaml
name: Breaking Changes

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Get CLI

          tar -xf datacontract.tar.gz
      - name: Check backwards compatibility 
        run: ./datacontract breaking --with https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datacontract/cli-examples/main/datacontract.yaml
```
